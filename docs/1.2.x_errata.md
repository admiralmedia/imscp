# i-MSCP 1.2.x -- Errata

## Update to version 1.2.1

### Package's restricted SQL users

The minimum length for usernames and passwords is now 6 characters long. Due to this change, it is possible that during
the update you need to update them.

### Webmails

Multiple webmails are now supported. You can install either no webmail, one webmail or many webmails at same time. You
can reconfigure list of webmails to install by running the following commands:

```
# perl imscp-autoinstall -dr webmails
```

At this moment Roundcube and RainLoop webmails are available.

## Update to version 1.2.0

### Pre-update tasks
 
Prior to any update attempt, it is greatly recommended to deactivate all plugins through the plugin interface. Once the
update is done, you must re-activate the plugins one at a time. If something goes wrong with a plugin, you can post in
the plugins support section, and our development team will fix the issue as soon as possible.
 
### i-MSCP frontEnd access
 
i-MSCP 1.2.0 introduces support for the Nginx Web server which is currently used only by the i-MSCP frontEnd. From now,
the i-MSCP frontEnd is run through a dedicated httpd instance, and is reachable through the following http(s) ports:

``
8080 ( http )
4443 ( https )
``

You can set different ports by editing the /etc/imscp/imscp.conf file, and by re-running the i-MSCP installer. Be aware
that the common http(s) ports ( 80 and 443 ) are reserved, and therefore, must not be used. If you want keep access to
the panel though these ports, you can install the following plugin which will act as a proxy:

* https://github.com/i-MSCP/plugins/tree/master/incubator/PanelRedirect
 
Having the i-MSCP frontEnd running with a dedicated httpd instance means that even if your Apache instance is down, the
panel will stay reachable. You can manage the i-MSCP frontEnd service with the following commands:

```
# service imscp_panel <action>
# service nginx <action>
```

### Hook files / Listener files
 
Hooks files are now known as listener files. A listener file is a Perl script which contains one or many event listeners
registered on the events manager and triggered by the same. The old **/etc/imscp/hooks.d** directory has been renamed to
**/etc/imscp/listeners.d** directory for consistency reasons.
 
### Installer command line options
 
Many options were either added, removed or simply renamed. You can get the full list of available command line options
by running the following command:

```
	# perl imscp-autoinstall -?
```
